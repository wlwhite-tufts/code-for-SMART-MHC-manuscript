# code-for-SMART-MHC-manuscript
This repository contains code and computational design protocol descriptions associated with "Design of solubly expressed miniaturized SMART MHCs" (White et. al, PNAS, in review).

Each of the numbered directories contains the following information for each of the major design protocols that were carried out:
- a `protocol_overview.txt` file which outlines the steps that make up the protocol
- code and detailed instructions for running each step of the protocol (some protocols have numbered sub-directories with a detailed `README.txt` file for each step)

Several software packages (listed below) are necessary to run these protocols:
- Rosetta (https://docs.rosettacommons.org/docs/latest/Home)
- PatchDock (https://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/PatchDock/)
- RIFdock (https://github.com/rifdock/rifdock/tree/master)
- Silent Tools (https://github.com/bcov77/silent_tools)
- DeepAccNet (https://github.com/hiranumn/DeepAccNet)
- BLAST (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK569861/)
- RFDesign (https://github.com/RosettaCommons/RFDesign)
- proteinMPNN (https://github.com/dauparas/ProteinMPNN)
- dl_binder_design (https://github.com/nrbennet/dl_binder_design)

The `design_models` folder contains the computational design models for each of the three stabilizers discussed in the paper.
